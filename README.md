# Features

* [constructor `new Atomicdb`](#constructor) (Create a new Instance)


## constructor
`new Atomicdb options`

options is a object containing the following keys - 

* `name` A name for the database. Must be unique on your host/domain.

* `storageEngine` A storageEngine. Compatible with `window.localStorage`, `window.sessionStorage`. You can set your own. A custom storageEngine has to be roughly compatible with the `window.localStorage` specs. Basically, it needs to implement the functions in `window.localStorage` such as `getItem`, `setItem`, etc. For in-memory operation, we suggest you use [memorystorage module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memorystorage) by [stijndewitt](https://www.npmjs.com/~stijndewitt)

* `serializationEngine` A way to serialize object to string and back. JSON.stringify and JSON.parse is a good example. You can of course set your own. As long as it has the `stringify` and `parse` methods, you are golden.

**Example:**
```coffee-script
db = new Atomicdb {
  name: 'test-db'
  storageEngine: localStorage
  serializationEngine: JSON
  commitDelay: 'none'
  uniqueKey: '_id'
}
```
